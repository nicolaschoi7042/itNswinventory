# PRD: Next.js Framework Migration for IT Asset & Software Inventory Management System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the complete migration of the existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based IT Asset & Software Inventory Management System to a modern Next.js framework with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. **The primary objective is to modernize the technology stack while maintaining 100% functional parity with the existing system** - no functionality will be lost or modified during migration.

The current system operates as a traditional web application with server-side Node.js API and client-side vanilla JavaScript. The goal is to transform this into a modern React-based application with server-side rendering capabilities, improved type safety, and enhanced developer experience **while ensuring that all existing features, workflows, user roles, authentication, and business logic remain identical to the current system.**

## Goals

1. **Technology Modernization**: Migrate from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to Next.js 14+ with TypeScript **while maintaining 100% functional parity**
2. **Performance Enhancement**: Achieve faster page load times through SSR and code splitting **without breaking any existing features**
3. **Developer Experience**: Improve maintainability and development speed with modern tooling **while preserving all current functionality**
4. **UI/UX Consistency**: Implement Material-UI components while preserving New York Business theme **maintaining identical user experience**
5. **Type Safety**: Eliminate runtime errors through comprehensive TypeScript implementation **without changing current behavior**
6. **Scalability**: Create a foundation for future feature development and system expansion **built on solid existing functionality**
