# PRD: Next.js Framework Migration for IT Asset & Software Inventory Management System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the complete migration of the existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based IT Asset & Software Inventory Management System to a modern Next.js framework with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. The migration aims to modernize the technology stack while maintaining all existing functionality and improving development productivity and system performance.

The current system operates as a traditional web application with server-side Node.js API and client-side vanilla JavaScript. The goal is to transform this into a modern React-based application with server-side rendering capabilities, improved type safety, and enhanced developer experience.

## Goals

1. **Technology Modernization**: Migrate from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
2. **Performance Enhancement**: Achieve faster page load times through SSR and code splitting
3. **Developer Experience**: Improve maintainability and development speed with modern tooling
4. **UI/UX Consistency**: Implement Material-UI components while preserving New York Business theme
5. **Type Safety**: Eliminate runtime errors through comprehensive TypeScript implementation
6. **Scalability**: Create a foundation for future feature development and system expansion

## User Stories

### For System Administrators
- **As a system administrator**, I want the application to load faster so that I can manage assets more efficiently
- **As a system administrator**, I want consistent UI components so that the interface is more intuitive to use
- **As a system administrator**, I want the same LDAP authentication to continue working so that existing user access remains uninterrupted

### For End Users  
- **As an employee**, I want faster page transitions so that I can quickly access my assigned assets
- **As an employee**, I want a responsive interface so that I can use the system on mobile devices
- **As an employee**, I want the familiar interface design so that I don't need to relearn the system

### For Developers
- **As a developer**, I want TypeScript support so that I can catch errors at compile time
- **As a developer**, I want component reusability so that I can build features more efficiently  
- **As a developer**, I want modern development tools so that I can debug and maintain code more effectively
