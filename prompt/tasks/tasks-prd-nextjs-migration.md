# Next.js Migration Task List

Based on the analysis of the existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript IT Asset & Software Inventory Management System and the PRD requirements, this task list outlines the complete migration to Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS while maintaining 100% functional parity.

## Current System Analysis

**Existing Architecture:**
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (`script.js`) with single HTML file (`index.html`)
- Backend: Express.js server (`backend/server.js`) with PostgreSQL database
- Authentication: LDAP + local database fallback with JWT tokens
- Features: Employee management, hardware/software inventory, asset assignments, user management
- Role-based access: Admin, Manager, User roles with specific permissions

**Migration Requirements:**
- Preserve all existing functionality exactly
- Maintain New York Business theme appearance
- Keep LDAP authentication and role-based access control
- Ensure API contract compatibility
- Maintain current responsive behavior
