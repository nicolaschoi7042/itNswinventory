# Tasks for New York Business Theme Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `styles-ny-business.css` - New CSS file containing the complete New York business theme styling
- `styles.css` - Original CSS file to be kept as backup  
- `index.html` - Main HTML file that may need CSS reference updates
- `script.js` - JavaScript file for any theme-related functionality (theme switching mechanism)

### Notes

- The implementation will create a new CSS file rather than modifying the existing one
- Original styles.css will be preserved as backup for rollback capability
- No changes to JavaScript functionality are required, only visual styling
- Theme can be tested by temporarily switching CSS file reference in index.html
