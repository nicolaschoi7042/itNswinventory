   - Background: Off-white (#FAFAFA)
   - Accent: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
   - Text: Dark gray (#374151)

1.2. Implement semantic colors for status indicators:

   - Info: Dark blue (#1E3A8A)

### 2. Typography System

2.2. Primary font: 'Inter', '-apple-system', 'BlinkMacSystemFont', 'Segoe UI', sans-serif
2.3. Define consistent font sizes, weights, and line heights for all text elements
2.4. Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility (minimum 4.5:1)

### 3. Component Redesign
3.1. **Navigation Bar**: Sleek horizontal design with subtle shadows and hover effects
3.2. **Buttons**: Minimalist design with hover states and proper spacing
3.3. **Tables**: Clean lines, alternating row colors, and professional borders
3.4. **Forms**: Modern input fields with floating labels and validation states
3.5. **Modals**: Centered design with backdrop blur and smooth animations
3.6. **Cards**: Subtle shadows, rounded corners, and consistent padding
3.7. **Status Badges**: Refined design with appropriate colors and typography

### 4. Layout and Spacing

### 6. Dark Mode Preparation
6.1. Structure CSS variables to support future dark mode implementation
6.2. Ensure color choices work well in both light and potential dark variants

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Functional Changes**: No modifications to existing business logic, API endpoints, or data structures
2. **New Features**: No additional functionality beyond visual improvements
3. **Framework Migration**: No migration from vanilla CSS to CSS frameworks
4. **Performance Optimization**: Focus is on visual design, not performance improvements
5. **Accessibility Overhaul**: Basic accessibility maintained, but comprehensive audit is separate
6. **IE Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Design Considerations

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use font weight and size to establish clear information hierarchy
- Implement consistent spacing to group related elements
- Utilize subtle shadows and borders to define component boundaries

### Professional Aesthetics
- Maintain clean, uncluttered layouts
- Use subtle gradients and shadows sparingly for depth
- Ensure consistent alignment and proportions

### Brand Consistency
- All UI elements should reflect the sophisticated New York business aesthetic
- Maintain consistency across all pages and components
- Use the monochromatic palette consistently throughout

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- Create a new `styles-ny-business.css` file to replace existing styles
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for maintainable color and sizing systems
- Maintain existing HTML structure and JavaScript functionality
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility for modern browsers

### CSS Architecture
```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #2C2C2C;
  --color-secondary: #6B7280;
  --color-background: #FAFAFA;
  --spacing-base: 8px;
  --font-primary: 'Inter', -apple-system, sans-serif;
}
```

### File Structure
- Keep existing `styles.css` as backup
- Implement theme switching mechanism for future scalability
- Organize CSS using logical component-based sections

## Success Metrics

1. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from 90% of regular users regarding visual improvements
2. **Professional Appearance**: Approval from management/stakeholders on the new professional look
3. **Usability Maintenance**: No decrease in task completion rates or user efficiency
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Consistent appearance across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
5. **Responsive Performance**: Proper display across desktop (1920px+), tablet (768px-1919px), and mobile (320px-767px) viewports

## Open Questions

1. **Animation Preferences**: Should we include subtle page transition animations, or keep interactions minimal?
2. **Logo Integration**: Will a company logo be added to match the new professional theme?
3. **Print Styles**: Do we need to create print-friendly versions of reports with the new styling?
4. **Theme Rollout**: Should we implement a gradual rollout or deploy the complete theme at once?
5. **User Feedback Mechanism**: How should we collect user feedback during the theme transition period?
